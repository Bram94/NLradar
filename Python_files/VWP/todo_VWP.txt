To add to right-click menu:
- VVP horizontal data range
- Display settings:
	- Storm motions to show
	- Shear/SRH height ranges
	- Maybe colors?

- self.pb.update()?
- Make vmin adjustable? Add default values in windows


- Data range
- VVP method
- Maybe add option to use vertical polarization instead of horizontal polarization because of
issue with Herwijnen radar? Or maybe I should blend both channels (before applying dealiasing)?
- Maybe fix issue with weird velocities Zaventem by excluding bins with Z<-15 dBZ?
- Import for every scan in get_data_multiple_scans when duplicate scans are present (Zaventem).
Maybe add option add_duplicates to the function?
- Weird low velocities in regions with no or very low reflectivity close to the radar for DWD radars
- Opening two NLradar windows for same radar leads to different surface obs stations
- sigma-max
- sector pairs
- Other filled sectors requirement closer to radar, since less data availabe there
- z_order sigma circles. They get defined later, and it has been observed that they were plotted
on top of a storm motion marker!
- VVP window relative width: max 0.255, less if the screen ratio is larger than the default of 16/9.
- Remove the use of pairs of sectors in the data availability check
- Maybe include data span angle to data availability check: Require that the largest azimuthal
range that is void of 

Dealing with extended dealiasing:
-Fit
-Two groups
-Determine for which group mean phase closest to zero
-Correct other group

sfc obs:
Download -> Datetimes in names
Check presence files -> check datetime within any datetime range files
stationslist with end_datetime
Status update for downloading in text bar
Exclusion of station IDs, stations might be availabe for other times!!!
Check stations DWD for date range with available data, and filter the station list.
Add option of manually inputting sfc obs
Displaying errors in status bar, at least the API key error!!!
