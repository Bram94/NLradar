Circular Layout
===============

This module contains several graph layouts which rely heavily on circles.

    Parameters
    ----------
    adjacency_mat : matrix or sparse
        The graph adjacency matrix
    directed : bool
        Whether the graph is directed. If this is True, is will also
        generate the vertices for arrows, which can be passed to an
        ArrowVisual.

    Yields
    ------
    (node_vertices, line_vertices, arrow_vertices) : tuple
        Yields the node and line vertices in a tuple. This layout only yields a
        single time, and has no builtin animation
