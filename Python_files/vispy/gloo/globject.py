Base gloo object

On queues
---------

The queue on the GLObject can be associated with other queues. These
can be queues of other gloo objects, or of the canvas.context. Queues that are
associated behave as if they are a single queue; this allows GL commands for
two or more interdependent GL objects to be combined such that they are always
sent to the same context together.

A program associates the textures/buffers when they are set via __setitem__. A
FrameBuffer does so when assigning buffers. A program associates itself
with the canvas.context in draw(). A FrameBuffer does the same in
activate().

Example:

    prog1, prog2 = Program(), Program()
    tex1, tex2 = Texture(), Texture()

    prog1.glir.associate(tex1.glir)  # prog1 and tex1 now share a queue
    prog2.glir.associate(tex2.glir)  # prog2 and tex2 now share a queue

    # this causes prog1, tex1, and canvas.context to all share a queue:
    canvas.context.glir.associate(prog1.glir)
    # and now all objects share a single queue
    canvas.context.glir.associate(prog2.glir)
 
Now, when the canvas flushes its queue, it takes all the pending commands
from prog1, prog2, tex1, and tex2.
