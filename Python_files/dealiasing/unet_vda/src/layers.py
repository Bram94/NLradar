    A variation of the traditional Conv2D layer that accounts
    for masked pixels.   
    
    NOTE:   This only works if stride=1 and padding='valid'
    
    Given a batch of image tensors I  with shape [N,L,W,C] 
    and a binary mask M with shape [N,L,W,C], this layer computes the
    following masked image convolution [*M] with weights W defined as
    
    I [*M] W =  ( (IxM) * W ) x M  + bias
    
    where * is traditional convolution and x is element-wise multiplication.
    
    If the setting normalize_with_masked_weights is set to True, this
    layer also normalizes the above by the convolution of M and W:
    
    (I [*M] W) / (M * W) + bias
